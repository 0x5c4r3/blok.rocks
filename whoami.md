Sometimes it's better to remain in the shadow, so I won't give you much info and you will not ask.<br>
You can call me Scarecrow, or 0x5c4r3 if you can pronounce it.<br>
Briefly, I have spent my University Carreer studying Cyber Security and I am an Offensive Security Certified Professional.
I hacked over 150 machines around HackTheBox, TryHackMe, RootMe, VulnHub.. and I constantly study new ways of breaking through defenses, CVEs and zero days.

Fair enough, dumbass?

Send me your virtual hug by email, hun <3
