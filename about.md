# << WHOTF am I >>
<br>
I won't give you much info, so don't ask.
Just so you know, I have a BSc in Computer Science, a MSc in Cyber Securty and I am an Offensive Security Certified Professional.
I hacked over 150 machines around HackTheBox, TryHackMe, RootMe, VulnHub.. and I constantly study new ways of breaking through defenses, CVEs and zero days.

Is that enough, dumbass?
