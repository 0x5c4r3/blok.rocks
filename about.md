Sometimes it's better to remain in the shadow, so I won't give you much info and you will not ask.<br>
You can call me Scarecrow.<br>
Briefly, I have spent my University Carreer studying Cyber Security and I am an Offensive Security Certified Professional.
I hacked over 150 machines around HackTheBox, TryHackMe, RootMe, VulnHub.. and I constantly study new ways of breaking through defenses, CVEs and zero days.

Fair enough, dumbass?
<br><br>
Yeah so, long story short, I was bored of playing games and hacking casual machines, so I came out with this idea: why not wasting time and money on creating a format to share cyber security knowledge and create a web of interested hackers - I know that you are script kiddies, don't lie to me - to share knowledge with?<br>
Since I just finished my University carreer and I think I GOT SKILLZ, my main goal's to create a different type of content, not the usual Teacher-Students approach, but a way of "learning togheter", aka I keep doing stuff and you babies keep discovering new things along with me.<br>I'm still working on the idea, I know, there's plenty of work to do but HEY, COVID19 had locked us home again so..
