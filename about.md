<br>
I won't give you much info, so don't ask.
I have spent my University Carreer studying Cyber Security and I am an Offensive Security Certified Professional.
I hacked over 150 machines around HackTheBox, TryHackMe, RootMe, VulnHub.. and I constantly study new ways of breaking through defenses, CVEs and zero days.
