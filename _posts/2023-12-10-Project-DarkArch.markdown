So I recently changed workplace as I received a nice offer from a big company, so with the moving and all the burocratic stuff I ended up with 2 weeks of boring nothingness waiting to start with the new job, therefore the nerd in me saw the opportunity to resume a project I started some years ago: an Arch testing machine using i3 that looks badass and works like magic.
I had an old Macbook Pro (late 2012) that I wasn't really using anymore, so I just wiped that and started building like crazy because why not and I gotta say I'm quite happy with the result, looks sick and works fine. 

TLTR: Yeh I got it working, it looks sick, references for the tools I installed down below.

Here's a quick view:

I started the p√®roject flashing the usual <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/" style="color:red;">Arch Kernel</a> on live USB.

I started in December and I was basically done with the theory mid May. Ngl, I did do some of the exercises of the course, but most of the time I was just following step-by-step what the documentation explained, doing exactly what was described and trying to understand how everything worked. I used <a href="https://obsidian.md/" style="color:red;">Obsidian</a> to take notes instead of CherryTree and I must say I kinda liked it, very handy and good looking.
&nbsp;
The notes taking is really crucial, the course fully explains how to build several C# exploits, but often the only necessary part is the final script (this is a very important tip on how to take notes: since there is a lot of theory to go through, make sure to highlight the final/best scripts to then reuse those in other situations! Theory will describe every exploit from the simple ones to the more complicated - if you have the possibility, always use the sophisticated ones first, as they have more chances of working and not being detected by AVs).
