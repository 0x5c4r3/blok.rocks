&nbsp;

Before getting into more advanced methodologies, it's always better to understand how the process works. In order to do that, I started hacking simple devices such as radio doorbells, remotes, iot devices and so on. Note that most of these devices, if bought recently, implement Rolling Code algorithms. If you want to find a device that still uses the single code approach, you can find an old/cheap one online.

In my case, I used radio doorbell.

very simple, very cheap.
