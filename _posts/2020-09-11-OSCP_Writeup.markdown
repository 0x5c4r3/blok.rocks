 <h1>OSCP Writeup - Scarecrow's Experience<h1>

<body>
<p>
Eyo kiddies,
yea I did it. I passed the OSCP exam.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who do not know what the OSCP is, it's the Offensive security Certified Professional, a really fucked up certification that basically leads you to shot yourself in the knee.
It's the N.1 certification for Penetration testers: during this journey, you basically learn all the foundamentals to perform a good penetration test against different structures, platforms, OS... ending with the notorious 24h exam.
But I am not here to describe you what the OSCP is, so if you want, google it ffs.

My journey started back in May 2020, in full Lockdown, nothing to do apart from working, no parties, no meetings.. So I decided to commit suicide and enroll in the PWK course (Penetration testing with Kali Linux, it's the course you need to follow to prepare for the OSCP) and attempting its final exam.
