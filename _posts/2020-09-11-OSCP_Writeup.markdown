 <h1>OSCP Writeup - Scarecrow's Experience</h1>

<body>
<p>
Eyo kiddies,
yea I did it. I passed the OSCP exam.
</p>
<p>
For those of you who do not know what the OSCP is, it's the Offensive security Certified Professional, a really fucked up certification that basically leads you to shot yourself in the knee.
It's the N.1 certification for Penetration testers: during this journey, you basically learn all the foundamentals to perform a good penetration test against different structures, platforms, OS... ending with the notorious 24h exam.
But I am not here to describe you what the OSCP is, so if you want, google it ffs.

INIT
<p>
My journey started back in May 2020, in full Lockdown, nothing to do apart from working, no parties, no meetings.. So I decided to commit suicide and enroll in the PWK course (Penetration testing with Kali Linux, it's the course you need to follow to prepare for the OSCP) and attempting its final exam.
My background was quite good in terms of Computer Science and general Cyber Security, plus I was in HTB since half a year approximately. Indeed, I already knew the majority of the stuff explained in the course. So I've been reading the whole course documentation in 2 weeks and I jumped into the LAB (basically you have 1/2/3 payable months to get a vpn access to a lab to test your skills) and here we have the real shit.

THE LAB
<p>
The Lab part is the worst, meaning that it's completly messed up, no guideline, no walkthrough or writeups, a disaster. I was constantly in contact with the Staff Chat to ask some questions about the machines - since I payed for it and I wanna learn as much as I can - and they kept replying to me that they were there to solve technical issues, not students questions. So yea, that was really fucking bad. Luckly I already was into htb so what I have done is I left the official lab and kept studying through htb or sites like that (much much much much better). Now I read that Offensive Security bought VulnHub, I guess they figured out they were providing such rotten lab service.
