# Hi, I am Scarecrow.

Yeah so, long story short, I was bored of playing games and hacking casual machines, so I came out with this idea: why not wasting time and money on creating a platform to share knowledge in cyber security and create a web of interested hackers - I know that you are script kiddies, don't lie to me - to share knowledge with?

Here we are.

Whoop Whoop!!!
