  <h1># Hi_I_Am_Scarecrow</h1>
  <p>Yeah so, long story short, I was bored of playing games and hacking casual machines, so I came out with this idea: why not wasting time and money on creating a format to share cyber security knowledge and create a web of interested hackers - I know that you are script kiddies, don't lie to me - to share knowledge with?
Since I just finished my University carreer and I think I GOT SKILLZ, my main goal's to create a different type of content, not the usual Teacher-Students approach, but a way of "learning togheter", aka I keep doing stuff and you babies keep discovering new things along with me. I'm still working on the idea, I know, there's plenty of work to do but HEY, COVID19 had locked us home again so..</p>
